This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that can process and summarize PDF documents using the OpenAI API for embeddings and LLM responses. The chatbot takes user queries, retrieves relevant information from the PDF, and provides answers in natural language.


Features

Text Summarization: Generates concise summaries of the document.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Uses embeddings and vector similarity to retrieve relevant chunks of text from the document.

Gradio Interface: A user-friendly interface for interacting with the chatbot.
